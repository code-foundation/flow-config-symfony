# Introduction

Flow Config is a key value configuration platform built on top of doctrine. It provides an PHP API for setting configuration
 at the platform that can be set by an install, and then set for a user, or other entity. Defaults are set in a single
 location, rather than scattering them through the code.

This package provides a Symfony 4 bundle for installing flow-config.

# Installation

```php
composer require code-foundation/flow-config-symfony
```

# Supported platforms
* PHP 7.1+
